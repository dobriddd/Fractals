# Fractals Exploration
## Overview
This project delves into the mathematical concept of Fractals, an infinitely complex self-similar patterns. Aimed at explaining and visualising how Fractals work, this exploration covers what they are, how are they created and where can we find them.
## Introduction
Fractals are complex geometric figures that display self-similarityâ€”patterns that repeat at different scales. Unlike traditional shapes in Euclidean geometry, fractals can have fractional dimensions, meaning they occupy space in ways that defy our usual understanding of lines, surfaces, and volumes. What makes fractals fascinating is that they are often generated by simple mathematical rules, yet produce infinitely intricate and detailed structures. Found both in nature (like snowflakes, coastlines, and trees) and mathematics (like the Mandelbrot and Julia sets), fractals reveal how complexity can emerge from simplicity.
